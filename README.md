## : about ❓

    Hi! 👋
    This repo is second part of two sections as this one represent my first effort on creating Full-Stack Web App 
    ( Back-End part with basic functionality  )

    start node.js server:
       1) make sure mysql is running in background ( i use brew services : enter brew services start mysql )
       2) npm run dev   ( see package.json for alias )  

    
    FE - Angular + Firebase ( auth still in progress )
    BE - Node.js ( RxJS , HTTPClient, mysql  )
